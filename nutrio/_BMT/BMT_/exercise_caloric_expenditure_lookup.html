<p>
As clear from the table, the more intense the exercise, the more calories you burn at that given moment. However, doing exercices less intense (and longer) will make you burn more calories during the coarse of the entire day, as it will increase your PAL far more than doing a short, intense workout. In addition, doing less intense exercices for longer will also increase your condition/stamina, whereas more intense, short exercises only increase the peak output you can generate. It is thus advisable to focus more on longer, less intense workouts if you're exercising for health. If you're however only working out to compensate for overconsumption of calories at a particular day, more intense exercices are better (as you'll spend less time on it then). That said, not overconsuming on calories will allow you of not doing any additional exercises at all, which will off course save you even more time.
</p>

<p>
The following table shows the sport zones, and thus give you an idea of what's intense or light for you (and whether you'll hence increase your PAL more or not by doing the exercises at the speed mentioned in the previous table):</p>

<table border = "1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Sport zone</td>
			<td>Intensity</td>
			<td>% of your total power output and heart beats per minute (average person)</td>
		</tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>very light</td>
			<td>50-60% of your total power output, 104 to 114 bpm</td>
		</tr>
		</tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>light</td>
			<td>60-70% of your total power output, 114 to 133 bpm</td>
		</tr>
		</tr>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>moderate</td>
			<td>70-80% of your total power output, 133 to 152 bpm</td>
		</tr>
		</tr>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>hard</td>
			<td>80-90% of your total power output, 152 to 172 bpm</td>
		</tr>
		</tr>
			<td>5</td>
			<td>very hard</td>
			<td>90-100% of your total power output, 171 to 190 bpm</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<p>
We should note here that the amount of beats per minute are for average people; people with a weak heart (or other illness) for instance will have far lower values. The amount of beats per minute are only indicative, and if you cause harm to your body due to misinterpretation, we can't be held responsable for that.
